-------------------------HOW TO PLAY!-------------------------------------

1. Assume in Level 1, the game shows Red. You need to click Red to advance to the next level.

2. Now, assume In Level 2, the game shows Blue. You need to click Red first, then Blue, to move on to the next level.

**Each level adds one more color to the sequence. The goal is to remember the sequence of colors and click them in the same order.
**If you make a mistake, the game will end. Try to go as far as you can!
